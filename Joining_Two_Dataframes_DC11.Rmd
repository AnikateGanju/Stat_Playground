## Chapter 11 Exercises

### Problem 11.1
The left_join, inner_join, and full_join data verbs require data as a paramenter because the function's purpose in itself is to join parts of data tables. Without a data table, we would get an error for no parameters given.

### Problem 11.2
There is no identifiers in either table for the data to match correctly.


### Problem 11.6

### Problem 11.7

[and so forth...]
